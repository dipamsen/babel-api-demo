# Using Babel Parser

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use the Babel parser to parse a simple JavaScript file and performing static analysis on the AST.

The React app renders a 'scope tree' from the parsed AST of the JavaScript file. This is a visual representation of the all the scopes, and the bindings within them.

Since Babel's API is not very well documented, this serves as a simple example which shows using the API to get scope information from the AST.

- `/docs` contains technical details about Babel's AST nodes and their properties.
